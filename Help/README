		Resolution
		Change the screen resolution
		by Guido Schimmels and Thomas Leonard

This program allows you to change the screen resolution at any time.
The change is not permanent. This is useful when connecting a laptop to
an external monitor or a projector, for example, which may require a different
screen resolution.

Resolution is simply a graphical front-end to the xrandr (X Rotate And Resize)
command-line utility, which you will also need. Modern X servers (such as
XFree86 and X.org) come with this program. If you don't have it, try upgrading
your X server.

Note that there is another, older, mechanism for changing resolution, often
activated by pressing <Ctrl>+<Shirt>+<Keypad Plus>. This still changes the
resolution, but your desktop remains the same logical size (i.e. you 'zoom in'
to the screen and must pan around to see your panel, etc).

If you want to change your computer's default resolution, or the list of
resolutions available, you will need to consult your X server documentation.
